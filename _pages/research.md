***[Trade Policy Uncertainty: Measurement and Impacts on US firms in Global Value Chains](../assets/pdf/Chen_Kairong_JMP.pdf)*** \\
<i>(Job Market Paper)</i> 
<div style="text-align: justify">  <i>Abstract:</i> This paper studies the effects of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on the US firms' global value chain links. I adapt a text-based method to construct new measures of trade policy shocks perceived by the US firms. I validate the TPU measure by showing that it correctly identifies text containing discussions on uncertainty about trade policy, that it varies intuitively over time and across sectors, and that it correlates with the firm's responses in investment and inventory in a manner that is highly indicative of trade policy uncertainty. High trade policy uncertainty deters capital investment and induces temporary stockpiling. These results continue to hold after controlling for news about the mean of trade policy shocks, and are robust to other investment and inventory variables. I then explore the impact on the firms' reliance on foreign relationships. Using the firm-level data on global supply chain relationships in 2010-2019, I find that TPU is negatively associated with the US firms' foreign customer ratios. The effects are more pronounced on downstream firms than upstream firms. By contrast, no association between TPU and foreign supplier ratios is found, probably due to the firms' additional offshoring behavior in the trade war.  </div>

***[Dynamic Effects of Trade Policy and Capital Control: A Terms-of-Trade Manipulation Perspective](../assets/pdf/Chen_Kairong_dynamic.pdf)*** 
<p style="text-align: justify">  <i>Abstract:</i> This paper studies the interaction between trade policy and capital control policy from a terms-of-trade manipulation perspective. I extend the dynamic two-country multi-good endowment economy in Costinot, Lorenzoni, and Werning (2014) with trade taxes/subsidies. Home country chooses optimal taxes on all tradable goods and international capital flows in order to maximize domestic welfare, while the foreign country is passive. When only good-specific trade taxes/subsidies are available, Home has an incentive to manipulate tariffs to depreciate its real exchange rate, if it has a faster-growing endowment than the Foreign. Moreover, I find that taxing capital inflow/subsidizing capital outflow is equivalent to a uniform reduction in gross trade tariffs on all goods. There is no need for capital controls if the government can get access to good-specific tariffs/subsidies. </p>
