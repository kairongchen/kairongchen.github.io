***Trade Policy Uncertainty: Measurement and Impacts on US firms in Global Value Chains*** \\
*(Job Market Paper, Latest Draft: August 2021)* \\
*Abstract:* This paper studies the effects of trade policy uncertainty on US firms' global value chain links. I adapt a text-based method to construct new measures of trade policy uncertainty perceived by US firms. With these new indexes, I estimate the effects of trade policy uncertainty shocks on firms' investment rate, inventory-sales ratio, and other behaviors. Firms exposed to high trade policy uncertainty retrench their investment in exporting participation, and thus foreign customer relationships are disrupted. Firms also stockpile inputs in anticipation of high trade policy uncertainty. The stockpiling behavior is temporary, implying that foreign supplier links are durable in a short time. Using firm-level data on supply chain relationships, I find that trade policy uncertainty is negatively associated with firms' foreign customer ratio. Among the sellers, downstream firms lose more foreign customers than upstream ones. In contrast, such association is not found between trade policy uncertainty and firms' foreign supplier links, regardless of firms' production position in the supply chain.

***Dynamic Effects of Trade Policy and Capital Control: A Terms-of-Trade Manipulation Perspective*** \\
(Latest Draft: May 2019) \\
*Abstract:*  This paper studies the interaction between trade policy and capital control policy from a terms-of-trade manipulation perspective. I extend the dynamic two-country multi-good endowment economy in Costinot, Lorenzoni, and Werning (2014) with trade taxes/subsidies. Home country chooses optimal taxes on all tradable goods and international capital flows in order to maximize domestic welfare, while the foreign country is passive. When only good-specific trade taxes/subsidies are available, Home has an incentive to manipulate tariffs to depreciate its real exchange rate, if it has a faster-growing endowment than the Foreign. Moreover, I find that taxing capital inflow/subsidizing capital outflow is equivalent to a uniform reduction in gross trade tariffs on all goods. There is no need for capital controls if the government can get access to good-specific tariffs/subsidies.
